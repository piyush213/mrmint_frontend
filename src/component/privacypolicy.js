                        by us and by those third parties with whom we may share your information in
                        various countries, including outside the United Kingdom. These countries may
                        have less stringent privacy laws than we do, so any information they hold

                        disclosure to governmental bodies, regulatory agencies and private persons.
                        In addition, a number of countries have agreements under which information
                        is exchanged with other countries for law enforcement, tax and other
                        purposes. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your

                        or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, if your data is

                        in some circumstances we anonymize your personal data (so that they can no
